•  1.3 billion tons of food are wasted every year</br></br>
•  This amounts to US$1 trillion dollars of wasted or lost food</br></br>
•  If wasted food was a country, it would be the third largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the United States and China</br></br>
•  Just one quarter of all wasted food could feed the 795 million undernourished people around the world who suffer from hunger</br></br>
•  Food waste in rich countries (222 million tons) is approximately equivalent to all of the food produced in Sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons)</br></br>
•  A European or North American consumer wastes almost 100 kilograms of food annually, which is more than his or her weight (70 kilograms)</br></br>
•  A European or North American consumer wastes 15 times more food than a typical African consumer</br></br>
•  Lack of technology and infrastructure is the main cause of food waste in Africa, as opposed to household food waste in the developed world</br></br>
•  Food waste in Europe alone could feed 200 million hungry people</br>

	How NGO’s, make profits?
</br></br>
• NGOs are therefore typically independent of governments</br></br>
•  Usually non-profit organizations that gain at least a portion of their funding from private sources. </br></br>
• Current usage of the term is generally associated with the United Nations and authentic NGOs are those that are so designated by the UN. Because the label “NGO” is considered too broad by some, as it might cover anything that is non-governmental, many NGOs now prefer the term private voluntary organization (PVO).</br></br>
• The term is usually applied only to organizations that pursue some wider social aim that has political aspects, but that are not overtly political organizations such as political parties. Unlike the term “intergovernmental organization”, the term “non-governmental organization” has no generally agreed legal definition. In many jurisdictions, these types of organization are called “civil society organizations” or referred to by other names.</br></br>
• Major fund-raising events require skills in advertising, media relations and motivating supporters.
